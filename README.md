H&M Product Recommendation Engine
This project implements a content-based recommendation system designed to suggest similar H&M products based on their attributes.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide relevant product recommendations by analyzing textual and categorical features of H&M apparel and accessories. It's built using Python and leverages common data science libraries.

Features
Data Loading & Preprocessing: Reads product data, handles missing values, and prepares the dataset.

Text Vectorization: Uses TF-IDF to transform product descriptions, colors, materials, and categories into numerical feature vectors.

Similarity Calculation: Employs Cosine Similarity to measure the likeness between products.

Interactive Recommendation: Allows users to input a product name and receive highly similar product recommendations.

Fuzzy Matching: Utilizes difflib for robust search queries.

How It Works
Data Ingestion: The H&M_dataset.csv file is loaded.

Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled, and irrelevant columns are dropped.

Feature Transformation: Key textual features are vectorized using TfidfVectorizer.

Feature Concatenation: All vectorized features are combined.

Similarity Matrix: A cosine similarity matrix is computed.

Recommendation: The system finds the closest product match for a user query and identifies other products with a high cosine similarity score (e.g., 0.75).
